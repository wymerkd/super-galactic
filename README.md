## Description

<!-- _This project demonstrates my current skills and understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Javascript, and jQuery. The application consists of an order form where the user can customize a pizza order. It collects data from the user and runs the it through a series of loops and branching to determine the price of the custom pizza. The resulting price and summary of their order will appear on the page when the submit button is clicked._ -->
