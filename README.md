# _Super Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _A web application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years, 11/15/2019_

#### By _**Kyle Wymer**_

## Description

_This project demonstrates my current skills and understanding of Test Driven Development. The application consists of a series of functions that calculate a user's age and life expectancy on a given planet. The application also breaks down each process into specifications and determines if code was written correctly by testing with Jest. The user's age is set to 29 and currently does not allow user to enter a specific age to be calculated._

## Specifications

|  Behavior | Input  | Output  |
|---|---|---|
| Should correctly create an age object with current age | 29 | 29 |
| Should correctly create an average life expectancy object with worldwide average life expectancy  | 71 | 71 |
| Should correctly determine if age types are numbers | 29 | 'number' |
| Should correctly divide user age by 0.24 to determine age on Mercury | 29 | 121 |
| Should correctly divide user age by 0.62 to determine age on Venus | 29 | 48 |
| Should correctly divide user age by 1.88 to determine age on Mars | 29 | 15 |
| Should correctly divide user age by 11.86 to determine age on Jupiter | 29 | 15 |
| Should correctly subtract user age from life expectancy on Earth | 29 | 42 |
| Should correctly subtract user age from life expectancy and divide result by .24 to determine life left on Mercury | 29 | 175 |
| Should correctly subtract user age from life expectancy and divide result by .62 to determine life left on Venus | 29 | 68 |
| Should correctly subtract user age from life expectancy and divide result by 1.88 to determine life left on Mars | 29 | 22 |
| Should correctly subtract user age from life expectancy and divide result by 11.86 to determine life left on Jupiter| 29 | 4 |
| If user is older than 71, should correctly subtract life expectancy (71) by user age to determine years lived past life expectancy| 80 | 9 |
